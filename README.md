# About Me
**Name:** Tyres Kiputa
**Hometown:** Nashville, TN
**Prior IT Experience:** I have very minimal IT experience. I was in college for IT, but made it to around ~1 1/2 semesters. I just felt as the way I was being taught was not for me.
**Career Plans:** After I complete this course, I would see what specific part of cybersecurity I am interested in most. There are lots of fields you could get into in the realm of cybersecurity, such as IAM, pen testing, etc. So it is important to me that I chose one area I am interested in and become an expert in that role. 
**Proud Project/Task:** One task that I am proud of is that I built my computer a couple years ago. I had to watch a lot of videos, and certain parts were more disheartening than others, but I made it work after trial and error. Just recently in November, I upgraded some of my parts because I noticed my performance wasn't holding up as much as it was before.
